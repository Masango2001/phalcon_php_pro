# Stock and Sales Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a management system designed to streamline stock control, sales operations, and user account management for a business. It features three internal actors—Admin, Seller, and Storekeeper—each with distinct responsibilities.

## Actors and Responsibilities
- **Admin**: Oversees user account creation and assigns roles (Admin, Seller, or Storekeeper) to ensure secure access.
- **Seller**: Manages sales transactions, records sale details, and maintains customer information.
- **Storekeeper**: Handles product inventory, tracks stock levels, and coordinates with suppliers for restocking.

## Key Features
- **User Management**: Allows the Admin to set up and manage user accounts with appropriate roles.
- **Sales Management**: Enables Sellers to process sales and update customer records.
- **Stock Management**: Allows Storekeepers to monitor product stock and manage supply operations.

## System Components
- **Users**: Contains user details such as username, password, and role.
- **Sales**: Includes sale information like date, quantity, and unit price.
- **Products**: Stores product details.
- **Stocks**: Tracks inventory quantities and update dates.
- **Clients**: Holds client information such as name and contact details.
- **Suppliers**: Maintains supplier data.
- **Categories**: Organizes products into categories.
- **Supply**: Records supply details like quantity and date.

## How It Works
1. The Admin creates and assigns roles to users (Sellers and Storekeepers).
2. Sellers handle sales and update customer information.
3. Storekeepers manage stock levels and coordinate with suppliers for restocking.

## Future Improvements
- Develop a user-friendly interface.
- Add automated alerts for low stock levels.
- Enhance security with advanced access controls.
